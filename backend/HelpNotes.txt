Packages are organised by the functionality they provide in line with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern

Controller:
The controller package typically contains controller classes (annotated with @RestController or @Controller).
These classes handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the client.
The controller acts as the entry point to the application for external clients. It usually has methods that correspond to various endpoints, like /api/users or /api/orders, for example.

DTO (Data Transfer Object):
This package contains DTO classes, which are plain Java objects used to transfer data between layers of the application, especially between the controller and service layers.
DTOs are commonly used to define the data structure that is sent and received by the API (controller) without exposing internal models directly.
These objects are typically used to simplify or transform data when it is transferred, often hiding certain fields or reformatting complex objects into a more usable structure.

Model:
The model package contains the domain objects or entities that represent the data your application is working with.
These classes are typically annotated with @Entity (for persistence) and correspond to database tables. They define the structure of the data and might include relationships between entities, such as @OneToMany or @ManyToOne.
These are usually the core business objects that are used throughout the service and repository layers.

Repository:
The repository package contains repository interfaces that interact with the database.
These are often extending the JpaRepository, CrudRepository, or PagingAndSortingRepository interfaces from Spring Data JPA.
Repositories handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and data access logic, translating Java objects into database records and vice versa.
They abstract the underlying database queries, allowing developers to write minimal or no SQL.

Service:
The service package contains the business logic of the application.
Service classes (often annotated with @Service) are used to handle core operations and implement business rules.
These classes typically call the repository layer to perform CRUD operations on the models and interact with the controllers to serve data.
Services help to decouple business logic from the web layer (controllers) and repository layer (database access), promoting better separation of concerns.






Typical Flow in the Application:
1- Controller receives an HTTP request from the client, such as creating or fetching data.
2- It interacts with the Service, which contains the business logic.
3- The Service may call the Repository to perform database operations, either saving or fetching data based on the request.
4- The Model represents the data entities being manipulated.
5- DTOs are used to map or format the data being passed between layers, especially when returning data to the client or receiving it from a request.
